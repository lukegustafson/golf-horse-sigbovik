# golf-horse-sigbovik
This is a "sanitized" version of my submission to the Sigbovik Golf Horse competition (http://golf.horse/sigbovik/). "Sanitized" means I have changed the  string containing compressed data so as to not reveal my best solution. The code here still solves the problem, but it comes in at 602 bytes (GitHub shows 603 because it adds a newline at the end). My first submission, "auroch", was 564 bytes. My second submission, "auroch_v2", was 561 bytes, and used a different multiplier in place of 9.1.
